AS 3735-2001 does not directly provide a clear maximum crack width value, but it maintains the crack within the hairline range through limit design. The appendix notes of the standard point out that for concrete surfaces continuously submerged in water, the design should ensure that the average crack width does not exceed approximately 0.1 mm, and the same limit of 0.1 mm is required for surfaces intermittently exposed to liquid wetting/drying (such as the exterior of the structure). For bending cracks continuously exposed to liquid inside, the allowable average width is slightly higher, up to approximately 0.15 mm, but this is only applicable in situations without alternating dry and wet conditions.",

For free shrinkage concrete, the minimum reinforcement ratio is determined by the formula p_min = f_ct.3 / f_sy. For fully constrained structures, the minimum reinforcement ratio is determined by the rebar diameter according to Table 3.1, with a range from approximately 0.48% to 1.28%. The reinforcement requirements can be reduced by setting expansion joints (for example, a 15m spacing expansion joint can reduce about 25%). These requirements aim to promote a finer, more uniform distribution of cracks, avoiding the occurrence of wide cracks.",
